# Python Budgetting App
I structured the back-end logic for a simple budgetting app that can be used by new businesses to easily manage their assets and expenses.

Functions are provided to add, remove, and adjust values for each budgetted quantity, and to look at simple analytics based on these values. It uses a dictionary (hash-map) structure to keep track of each budget item, optimizing the runtime of the program when a a large volume of expenses or assets need to be tracked.

Potential expansions: Supplementary front-end interface to ease user use, usage of pandas library to incorporate more detailed analytics of the data
